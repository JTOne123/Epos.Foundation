## Docs

Epos.Foundation is the Github Repo for foundational utilities like String or Dictionary extension methods
(NuGet package **Epos.Utilities**) and a powerful and simple command line parser (NuGet package **Epos.CmdLine**).

The packages are implemented using .NET Standard (2.0+). Therefore you can use them cross-platform on any supported platform and
also with the full .NET Framework (4.6.1+).
